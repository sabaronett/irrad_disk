# Gray Absorption

Gray absorption models presented in Baronett, Jiang et al. (2025, Section 4.2.2).
- [`hybrid`](https://github.com/sabaronett/irrad_disk/tree/main/athena/models/gray_opac/absorption/hybrid) uses hybrid ray tracing (Section 4.1.2)
- [`multigroup`](https://github.com/sabaronett/irrad_disk/tree/main/athena/models/gray_opac/absorption/multigroup) uses our multigroup framework (Section 2) and model (Section 3)
