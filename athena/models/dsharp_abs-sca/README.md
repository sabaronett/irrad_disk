# Frequency-dependent Absorption and Scattering Opacities

Frequency-dependent models with absorption and scattering presented in Baronett, Jiang et al. (2025, Sections 4.3.2, 4.4, and 4.5).
- [`nfreq`](https://github.com/sabaronett/irrad_disk/tree/main/athena/models/dsharp_abs-sca/nfreq) is organized by the number of frequency bands $N_f$ (Sections 4.4.1, 4.5)
- [`nzeta`](https://github.com/sabaronett/irrad_disk/tree/main/athena/models/dsharp_abs-sca/nzeta) is organized by the number of cell-centered polar angles $N_\zeta$ between 0 and $\pi/2$ (Section 4.4.2)
