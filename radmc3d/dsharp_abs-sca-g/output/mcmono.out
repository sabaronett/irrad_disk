 Number of processors:          128
 Number of threads in use:          122
 Reading global frequencies/wavelengths...
 Reading grid file and prepare grid tree...
 Reading star data...
 Note: Please be aware that you treat the star(s) as
       point source(s) while using spherical coordinate mode.
       Since R_*<<R_in this is probably OK, but if you want
       to play safe, then set istar_sphere = 1 in radmc3d.inp.
 Note: Star 1 is taken to be a blackbody star
       at a temperature T = 5784. Kelvin
 Grid information (current status):
   We have 131072 branches, of which 131072 are actual grid cells.
   ---> 100.000% mem use for branches, and 100.000% mem use for actual cells.
   No grid refinement is active. The AMR tree is not allocated (this saves memory).
 Reading the heat source spatial distribution...
   --> Including dust
       No lines included...
       No gas continuum included...
 Reading dust data...
 Reading dust densities...
 Dust mass total =    1.3016781300033471E-004  Msun
 Reading dust temperatures...
 Beware: The OpenMP-parallel acceleration of RADMC-3D has 
         not yet been tested with all of the modes and
         features that RADMC-3D offers. Please check 
         your parallel results against the serial version
         (i.e. compiling without -fopenmp).
